## Usage
Click the "Generate Password" button. A prompt will appear asking for desired password length, provide a length between 8 and 128. After that several "yes" "no" confirm boxes will apprear allowing you to customize the password, once all options have been selected the password will appear on the page. 

## Conclusion
Through this project I was able to explorer javascript fundamentals of data storage and access, functions, loops, and working with user inputs.
